/**
 * A category of the Desktop settings panel, registered by another package.
 *
 * The panel's own categories are curated (`categories/index.ts`), and that stays true: a category of
 * this desktop's is a folder and one entry there. This type exists for the other case, a package
 * that adds apps to the desktop and has settings of its own for them, which the curated list cannot
 * hold without this repository knowing about that package. To the person using it, a package's
 * setting for its desktop apps is a desktop setting, so it belongs in the desktop's settings panel
 * rather than in a panel of its own.
 *
 * **Public API for other packages; nothing in this repository registers one.** It is documented in
 * `docs/desktop-apps.md` §6.1, and the host's own tests (`settings-modal.test.ts`) register fakes and
 * are what prove it works.
 *
 * What the host owns is the row, the navigation and the heading. What the package owns is the
 * element behind the row, and everything in it, including where its values are stored: the host
 * reads none of them, just as the panel reads no curated category's values either.
 *
 * `element` is resolved with Umbraco's own `createExtensionElement`, so every form an element may
 * take elsewhere in Umbraco works here. `conditions` are Umbraco's too and are honoured, through the
 * same `UmbExtensionsManifestInitializer` the registered apps use: a category whose conditions are
 * unmet has no row.

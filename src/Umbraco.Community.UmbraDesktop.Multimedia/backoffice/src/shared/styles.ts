/**
 * The surfaces every multimedia app is built from, written once.
 *
 * A copy of the Accessories package's stylesheet, because the two add-ons are independent: either
 * can be installed without the other, so neither may import from the other, and the host ships built
 * JavaScript rather than anything to import. Both are the same controls under the same theme, so a
 * Media Player button and a Notepad button look alike; keep the two copies in step.
 *
 * Each app is one custom element in its own window, and they share no state and no shell (the
 * desktop-apps design's §11 is explicit that a shared frame around several apps would make them one
 * app wearing several names). What they do share is a look, because Media Player's transport and
 * Picture Viewer's toolbar are the same control under the same theme. So this is ordinary code
 * reuse: one stylesheet each element adopts next to its own, and nothing else.
 *
 * Every rule reads the app tokens with the fallbacks `docs/developer/desktop-apps.md` §4 publishes, so the
 * apps render as the Umbraco theme with no theme set. The guide's traps all apply and are honoured
 * here rather than repeated per app: `background`, never `background-color`, since a surface token
 * may carry a gradient; lines between controls in `border`, not `edge-dark`, since only `border`
 * promises contrast; the sunken edge as a spread shadow rather than a border, so it costs no layout
 * and no declared size depends on a theme's bevel width; and every per-theme block a refinement on
 * top of correct unbranched rules, changing appearance and never geometry.

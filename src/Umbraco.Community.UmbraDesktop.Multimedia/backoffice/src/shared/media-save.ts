 * here with the public repositories it is built from: ask which media types accept the file's
 * extension, intersect that with what the folder allows, prefer a type that names the extension over
 * a catch-all, upload a temporary file, and create the item pointing at it. So a site that has
 * removed the File media type, or a folder that only allows images, refuses a save exactly as it
 * refuses a drag-and-drop, and says so in the same words.
 *
 * **A second save of the same document overwrites that item** instead of piling up copies, the way
 * Ctrl+S does everywhere: it reads the item, uploads the new file as a temporary file, points
 * `umbracoFile` at it and saves. If the item has gone (deleted, or in the recycle bin), the save
 * creates a new one instead, since the person asked for their work to be saved and not for that
 * particular item. **It never overwrites a version it has not seen**: if the item's update date is
 * not the one the document last saw, somebody replaced the file in the Media section meanwhile, and
 * the save writes nothing and answers with a conflict, unless the request says `force`. The check
 * and the write are two requests, so a change landing between them still wins last; the check is

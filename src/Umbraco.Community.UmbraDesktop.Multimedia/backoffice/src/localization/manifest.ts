 * This package's own localisation dictionaries, one manifest per culture.

 * Registered separately from the host's for the reason the Entertainment package gives: Umbraco
 * merges dictionaries by area and key at runtime, so a package ships the area it owns and nothing
 * has to be coordinated between releases. What lives here is the Multimedia group's heading, which
 * this package's catalogue defines, each app's name, which its manifest points at through
 * `meta.label`, and everything the apps themselves say.
